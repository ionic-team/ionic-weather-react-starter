# Ionic Weather React Starter

A starter application for the Ionic React enterprise training.

This is essentially the tabs starter with some initial changes to rename/move files and perform some other tedious tasks that end up taking extra time during class without real benefit.

This starter is used in conjunction with the training material found here: https://training-deck.firebaseapp.com/iw-crd-react

## Getting Started

The code here is intended to be used as the starting point for the weather application that is developed as a part of the Ionic Framework React training. Usually you will be told how to get started during the class.

If you want to use this starter outside of that environment for some reason, do this (substitute any app name you wish for `ionic-weather`):

- `git clone https://github.com/ionic-enterprise/ionic-weather-react-starter.git ionic-weather`
- `cd ionic-weather`
- `npm i`
- `ionic serve`

Don't worry, unless you are an Ionic team member you will not actually be able to push anything to the repo, and if you are an Ionic team member, please don't unless you are updating the training on purpose... ðŸ˜‚

## Using the `testing/stepByStep` Branch

The `testing/stepByStep` branch has been created to allow you to easily reset your local repo to the end of any given step. This allows you to skip to any step you need to or to give yourself a fresh starting point if you manage to make a mess as you are going (no shame, it happens...)

ðŸ¦„ðŸŒˆ Happy Coding!! ðŸ¦„ðŸŒˆ
